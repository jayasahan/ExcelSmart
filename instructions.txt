To let someone else test your add-in, you need to give them the manifest.xml file. This file is the key. It tells Excel everything it needs to know about your add-in, including where to load its content from.
How it works (for beta testing):
Your backend is live on Vercel. (Done!)
Your frontend (taskpane.html, etc.) is served securely from https://localhost:3000 when you run npm start.
You run npm start on your computer.
You send the manifest.xml file to your friend.
Your friend "sideloads" this file into their Excel (instructions below).
When they open the add-in, their Excel will load the user interface directly from your localhost:3000 server over the internet.
Limitation: This method requires your development server to be running for them to use the add-in. A full deployment (our next phase) will remove this dependency.


Here are the instructions to give your beta testers:

To Test with Excel on the Web (Easiest Method):

Open Excel in your web browser (e.g., at office.com).
 - Go to the Insert tab and click Add-ins.
 -In the top right, select the MY ADD-INS tab.
 -At the bottom of the window, click the "Upload My Add-in" link.
 -Browse and select the manifest.xml file I sent you.
 -The "ExcelSmart" add-in is now installed. You can open it from the Home tab on the ribbon.

To Test with Excel on Windows Desktop:
 -Create a folder on your computer, for example: C:\ExcelAddins.
 -Place the manifest.xml file I sent you inside this folder.
 -In Excel, go to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings....
 -Go to Trusted Add-in Catalogs.
 -In the Catalog Url box, type the path to the folder you created (C:\ExcelAddins), click Add catalog, and make sure to check the "Show in Menu" box. Click OK.
 -Now, on the Insert tab, click My Add-ins, and at the top, select SHARED FOLDER. Your ExcelSmart add-in will appear there.

You are now fully equipped to run a beta test. You can start refining the AI prompt, improving the UI, and gathering valuable feedback for the next phase: a full production deployment.
